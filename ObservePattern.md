The Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. This allows a single object (the Publisher) to automatically notify a list of other dependent objects (the Subscribers) about any changes in its state.

This project demonstrates a clean and practical implementation of the Observer Pattern using TypeScript
Core Concepts and Features

This pattern is a powerful tool for building flexible and scalable software by minimizing direct dependencies between components.

Event-Driven Architecture: The pattern enables a system where objects react to events without needing direct knowledge of the event's source.

Decoupling: It significantly reduces dependencies, allowing the Publisher and Subscribers to be developed and evolve independently.

Dynamic Relationships: Objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from notifications at runtime, making the relationships highly flexible.

Scalability: You can add new Subscribers without having to modify the Publisher's code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

Project Structure
The code is organized to clearly illustrate the roles of each component in the Observer Pattern.

Subscriber Interface: Defines the update() method that all subscribers must implement to receive notifications.

Publisher Interface: Declares the subscribe(), unsubscribe(), and notify() methods for managing and communicating with subscribers.

Concrete Publisher (Editor class): A class that contains the business logic. It manages its list of subscribers and notifies them when its state changes.

Concrete Subscribers (LoggingListener, EmailAlertsListener): Classes that implement the Subscriber interface. They perform specific actions in response to notifications.

Client: The application's main logic that sets up the Publisher and its Subscribers.
