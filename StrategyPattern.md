Strategy Design Pattern
ðŸ“Œ Intent

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one in a separate class, and make them interchangeable at runtime.

ðŸš§ Problem

Imagine building a navigation app:

The first version supported car routes only.

Later updates added walking, public transport, cycling, and tourist routes.

Each new routing algorithm bloated the main navigator class.

Changes or bug fixes risked breaking existing functionality.

Teamwork became inefficient due to frequent merge conflicts.

ðŸ’¡ Solution

The Strategy pattern solves this by:

Extracting each algorithm into its own class called a Strategy.

Keeping a Context class that holds a reference to one strategy.

Letting the client decide which strategy to use at runtime.

Allowing new algorithms to be added without modifying existing code.




âœ… Applicability

Use the Strategy pattern when:

You need to switch between multiple algorithms at runtime.

You have many similar classes that differ only in algorithm behavior.

You want to reduce conditional statements in your code.

You want to isolate business logic from algorithm details.



ðŸ“š Summary

The Strategy Design Pattern provides flexibility by defining a family of interchangeable algorithms. It helps keep code clean, maintainable, and extensible, making it a go-to choice when working with dynamic algorithm selection.
